**Amount Requested**: $50,000  
**Deadline**: May 30, 2026

## Project Title

**Decentralized Opportunity Platform for Artists (CuratAI)**  
*An AI-powered, Web3-secured system to democratize access to cultural funding and platforms*

---

## Project Summary (250 words)

CuratAI addresses a critical gap in the cultural ecosystem: **artists lack systematic access to opportunities.**

Thousands of speaking engagements, exhibitions, and grants are posted online daily. Yet individual artists struggle to discover, apply for, and track these opportunities. The administrative burden is crushing. Opportunity discovery remains fragmented and inequitable.

CuratAI solves this through **autonomous agents, transparent evaluation, and Web3 provenance**:

1. **Opportunity Scout Agent**: Aggregates opportunities from 20+ sources. Ranks by relevance to each artist's profile, specialization, and history.

2. **Proposal Drafter Agent**: Generates tailored proposals in the artist's voice. Learns from past submissions to optimize tone, emphasis, and framing.

3. **Adaptive Strategy Agent**: Analyzes rejection/acceptance patterns. Provides data-driven recommendations for future submissions.

4. **Transparent Orchestration (Opik)**: Every decision is logged and explainable. Artists understand why their proposals succeeded or failed.

5. **Web3 Provenance (DID + IPFS)**: Cryptographically secure version history. Proves authorship and protects artist intellectual property.

### Impact

- **For Artists**: 10x reduction in opportunity-discovery time. Higher acceptance rates through adaptive strategies.
- **For Funders**: Better proposals with transparent reasoning chains. Reduced administrative burden.
- **For Equity**: Decentralized discovery model means underrepresented artists get equal visibility.

### Timeline

Phase 1 (Hackathon - Feb 2026): MVP with all core agents  
Phase 2 (Q2 2026): Public beta with 50+ artists  
Phase 3 (Q3 2026): Integration with 10+ major funding/opportunity sources

## Background & Need

### The Problem

Artists spend 40+ hours monthly on opportunity research, proposal writing, and deadline tracking. This diverts time from creative work. Moreover, these systems are:

- **Fragmented**: Opportunities scattered across dozens of platforms (LinkedIn, Submittable, direct emails)
- **Inefficient**: No learning loop—artists rewrite similar proposals without feedback
- **Inequitable**: Underrepresented artists lack networks and have fewer discovery channels
- **Opaque**: Artists don't understand why proposals are rejected

### The Opportunity

AI-driven agent systems, transparent orchestration (Opik), and decentralized identity (Web3) create a solution:
- Autonomous opportunity discovery
- Learning from real outcomes
- Cryptographic proof of authorship
- Community governance of opportunity curation

---

## Project Goals & Objectives

### Primary Goal
Create and deploy an open-source AI agent system that democratizes artist access to opportunities while maintaining transparency, security, and artist agency.

### Objectives

1. **Technical**: Build four autonomous agents (Scout, Drafter, Strategy, Calendar) coordinated via Opik
2. **Reach**: Beta test with 50+ artists in 6 months; expand to 500+ by year end
3. **Equity**: Track demographic diversity of users; ensure underrepresented artists benefit
4. **Sustainability**: Develop freemium model; aim for $50k ARR by end of 2026

---

## Methodology

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Hackathon)

**Agent Stack**:
- Python + OpenAI GPT-4 for core logic
- Opik for orchestration and observability
- DID + IPFS for Web3 integration
- SQLite for local state

**Key Deliverables**:
- Working prototype with all four agents
- Opik dashboard showing agent reasoning
- Sample proposals in 3 tones (formal, engaging, impact-driven)
- Transparent monitoring of acceptance rates

### Phase 2: Beta Testing & Iteration (Q2-Q3 2026)

- Deploy with 50 artists from diverse backgrounds
- Collect feedback on usability, agent quality, strategy effectiveness
- Iterate on LLM prompts based on real outcomes
- Build integrations with major opportunity sources

### Phase 3: Scale & Sustainability

- Expand to 500+ users
- Develop DAO governance for opportunity curation
- Launch paid tier; maintain free tier for underrepresented artists
- Open-source core agents for community contributions

---

## Expected Outcomes & Impact

### For Artists
- **Time Saved**: 90% reduction in opportunity-discovery time (40 hrs/month → 4 hrs/month)
- **Acceptance Rate**: 50% improvement through adaptive strategies
- **Resilience**: Reduced rejection fatigue via data-driven feedback

### For Cultural Ecosystem
- **Visibility**: Underrepresented artists gain equal discovery opportunities
- **Efficiency**: Funders receive better-tailored proposals
- **Innovation**: Demonstrates responsible AI in creative practice

### For the Field
- **Open-Source**: All agents released under MIT license
- **Standards**: Proposal for ISO standard on AI in creative tools
- **Education**: Curriculum module for art schools on AI literacy
