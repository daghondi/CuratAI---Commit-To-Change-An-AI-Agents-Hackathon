## Proposed Talk: "Amplify, Don't Replace: Building Ethical AI for Creatives"

### Core Thesis

While many fear AI's impact on creativity, the real opportunity lies in designing AI systems that empower artists and cultural workers. This talk explores how AI can enhance creative practice when designed with artists' agency at its center.

### Key Points

1. **The False Binary**: AI vs. Creativity is a false choice. The real question: How does AI enhance human creativity?

2. **Lived Experience**: Artists face systemic barriers—opportunity discovery, deadline management, rejection patterns. Technology can address these blockers.

3. **Case Study**: CuratAI—An agentic AI system that scouts opportunities, drafts proposals, and adapts based on real outcomes. It's not replacing artists; it's freeing them from administrative overload.

4. **Responsible AI**: Using Opik for transparency, Web3 for provenance, and continuous learning from outcomes. This is how you build AI systems creatives can trust.

### Audience Takeaways

- Understanding how AI can authentically serve creative practice
- Practical toolkit for evaluating AI tools critically
- Vision for collaborative human-AI workflows in the arts

### Why Now?

2026 is the pivotal year. The AI hype is settling. Now we need stories of **responsible, grounded, artist-centered** AI. This talk provides that narrative.
