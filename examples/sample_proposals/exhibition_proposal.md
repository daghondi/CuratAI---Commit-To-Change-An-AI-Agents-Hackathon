## Artist Statement

My work emerges at the intersection of generative systems and human narrative. Rather than viewing algorithms as autonomous creators, I collaborate with computational processes to explore emergent meaning. Each piece asks: What happens when human intention meets algorithmic possibility?

In *Algorithms of Feeling* (my recent exhibition at MoMA PS1), I created a series of interactive installations where generative AI systems responded to viewer emotions in real-time. Thousands of visitors discovered that AI systems, properly designed, can be partners in meaning-making rather than replacements for human creativity.

## Proposed Exhibition: "Amplification: AI as Creative Medium"

### Concept

A multi-part exhibition exploring AI not as a threat to artistic practice, but as a new medium—like photography was once feared, then embraced.

### Works (3-5 pieces)

1. **"Voices Layered"** (2024)
   - Interactive audio installation
   - Generative AI responds to live voices
   - Celebrates human diversity through algorithmic transformation

2. **"Archive Reimagined"** (2024)
   - Digital video series (5 min each, 3 pieces)
   - Historical photographs remixed through cultural memory models
   - Questions authenticity and collective memory

3. **"Feedback Loop"** (2025)
   - Real-time responsive environment
   - Visitors witness how AI systems learn and adapt
   - Metaphor for human-machine collaboration

### Curatorial Angle

This exhibition reframes AI from threat to tool to partner. It's timely—2026 is when public opinion on creative AI is forming. We have the chance to shape that narrative toward collaboration, not replacement.
