# CuratAI - 2-3 Minute Pitch Script

## Opening (15 seconds)

"Hello, I'm [Name], and I want to tell you about CuratAI—an agentic AI system that's changing how artists access opportunities.

You know that feeling? Hours spent scrolling opportunity listings. Days drafting tailored proposals. Weeks waiting for decisions. Months of rejection fatigue. **CuratAI eliminates all of that.**"

## Problem (30 seconds)

"Artists and cultural professionals face a broken system:
- Scattered opportunities across dozens of platforms
- Writing custom proposals for each opportunity takes days
- No feedback loop—you don't know why you're rejected
- Critical deadlines slip through the cracks

But here's the key insight: **These problems aren't about lack of opportunity. They're about lack of _systems_.**"

## Solution (1 minute)

"CuratAI deploys **four autonomous agents** working together:

1. **Scout Agent**: Finds the right opportunities for _you_. Not generic. Not random. Hyper-relevant.

2. **Drafter Agent**: Generates proposals in your unique voice. Takes your portfolio, your bio, your vision—and writes something that gets noticed.

3. **Strategy Agent**: Learns from outcomes. Every rejection teaches it. Every acceptance refines it. Success rate goes up automatically.

4. **Calendar Agent**: Deadline management, reminders, follow-ups. Never miss an opportunity again.

All orchestrated by Opik for transparency. All versions tracked on IPFS for provenance. All secured with DIDs for authenticity."

## Demo (30 seconds)

"Let me show you what this looks like in action...

## Closing (30 seconds)

"CuratAI is not just a tool. It's an **agentic system**—truly autonomous, learning from real outcomes, adapting to you.

It embodies this hackathon's vision: AI that doesn't replace human creativity. AI that **amplifies** it.

For artists, curators, and creative professionals: your time is too valuable to spend on administration. Let your agents handle the logistics. You focus on the art.

CuratAI. Autonomy for artists.

## Key Talking Points (Reference)

If asked about:

**"How is this different from existing tools like LinkedIn or even ChatGPT?"**
> "ChatGPT writes generic proposals. CuratAI learns _your_ voice and _your_ success patterns. Every proposal gets better. Plus—CuratAI runs autonomously. You don't prompt it weekly. It scouts for you, drafts for you, learns for you."

**"How do you prevent AI-generated spam?"**
> "Every proposal is version-tracked on IPFS with cryptographic signatures (DIDs). Humans always review before submission. And Opik gives full transparency into the agent reasoning—we can prove the AI followed ethical guidelines."

**"What about rejection? How does the system handle that?"**
> "That's where adaptation happens. When a proposal is rejected, the Strategy Agent analyzes: Was it the tone? The venue? The timing? It hypothesizes and tests improvements—A/B testing different strategies."

**"Scale question: Does this work for non-artists?"**
> "Absolutely. Any professional with a portfolio and career goals benefits: Writers, musicians, researchers, entrepreneurs seeking funding. The agents are configurable."

**"Web3—why does that matter?"**
> "Provenance and trust. In a world of AI-generated content, DIDs prove _you_ authored the proposal. IPFS creates an immutable record. Future: DAO governance lets the community vote on opportunities."

## Hackathon Judges' Framing

Lead with: **"This demonstrates agentic AI done right."**

Then show:
1. **Autonomy**: Agents act without constant human prompts
2. **Reasoning**: Opik shows the thinking
3. **Adaptation**: Real outcomes improve future behavior
4. **Responsibility**: Web3 + Opik provide full transparency
5. **Impact**: Real problem, real solutions for real users

**Closing line**: "CuratAI isn't just innovative. It's _responsible_ innovation—agentic systems you can actually trust."
