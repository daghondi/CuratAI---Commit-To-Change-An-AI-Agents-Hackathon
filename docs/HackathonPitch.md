# CuratAI - Hackathon Pitch

## The Problem (30 seconds)

Artists and cultural professionals spend countless hours hunting for opportunities—speaking engagements, exhibitions, grants. Then comes the painful part: writing personalized proposals for each one. Success feels random. What worked last time might fail this time. There's no system.

## The Solution (30 seconds)

**CuratAI**: Four intelligent agents working together.

1. **Scout Agent** finds opportunities that fit *your* profile
2. **Drafter Agent** writes proposals in *your* voice
3. **Strategy Agent** learns from outcomes and improves your approach
4. **Calendar Agent** never lets a deadline slip

All orchestrated by **Opik**. All versions tracked on **Web3** for authenticity.

## Why This Matters (30 seconds)

This is **real agentic AI**—not a chatbot, but autonomous agents that reason, act, and adapt. It's proof that AI can amplify human creativity, not replace it. And it gives that proof a cryptographic signature: every proposal version stored immutably on IPFS, provenance tracked via DIDs.

## What You'll See in the Demo (1 minute)

1. **Live Agent Workflows**: Watch the Scout find opportunities, the Drafter write proposals
2. **Opik Dashboard**: Real-time metrics on agent performance, experiment results
3. **Sample Proposals**: Three generated proposals (speaking, exhibition, grant) with tone variants
4. **Web3 Provenance**: Version history of a proposal stored immutably
5. **Strategy Insights**: How the system adapts based on success patterns

## Why We Built This

For the hackathon theme **"Commit to Change"**:
- **Agentic AI**: We committed to building truly autonomous agents, not just LLM wrappers
- **Empowering Change**: Artists and creatives get real, practical power to scale their impact
- **Transparent AI**: Opik + Web3 prove that AI agents can operate with full accountability

## Call to Action

CuratAI is open-source from day one. Judge it, run it, extend it. Because the future of AI isn't about replacing creativity—it's about amplifying it.
